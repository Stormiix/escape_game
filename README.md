# Igor did it again - Escape Game

Basic escape game password interface with a 45min countdown timer. The password is made of 5 parts which can be retrieved by solving some puzzles.
This was made as part of an English assignement. Code is messy but can be easily modified to suit other escape games that rely on the same "solve puzzles to get password" mechanic.

Built using VueJS & tailwindcss.
